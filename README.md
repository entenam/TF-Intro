# FashionMnistClassification.ipynb
- Run a Simple Sequential Model over Fashion MNIST Dataset From Keras
- Demonstrate How to Use Custom Callbacks and Multiple Callbacks
- Demonstrate How to Save Checkpoints While Training and Load Checkpoints Later Avoiding Training to Save Time and Resources
- The Code Can be Executed Directly in Google CoLab
